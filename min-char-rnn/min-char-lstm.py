# Minimal character-based language model learning with an LSTM architecture.
#
# Overall code structure based on Andrej Karpathy's min-char-rnn model:
#    https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086
#
# But the architecture is modified to be LSTM rather than vanilla RNN.
# The companion blog post is:
#   https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/minimal-character-based-lstm-implementation/
#
# Tested with Python 3.6
