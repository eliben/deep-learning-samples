    # Our input is (x,y) -- 2D. Output is the scalar y^ computed by the
    # dot-product of (1, x, y) with theta (1 is for the bias, and theta_0 is the
    # bias parameter). This is a plane equation in 3D.
    # Therefore, the plot we aim to produce is 3D -- some scalar as a function
    # of two parameters. The contours are then the equi-value lines of the 3D
    # plot, and we're only interested in the main contour at value 0 -- meaning
    # the line where the plane intersects the x/y plane.
    #
    # Note: if we flip all values here we get the same intersection.
